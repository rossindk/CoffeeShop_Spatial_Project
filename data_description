# Data Description

## Overview

This project integrates multiple spatial and non-spatial datasets to analyze the accessibility of coffee shops across Jakarta. The data originates from open-source platforms and government statistics portals.

---

## 1. Coffee Shop Locations

**Source:** OpenStreetMap (OSM)  
**Data Type:** Point Geometry  
**Format:** Extracted OSM Points → CSV → PostGIS  

### Attributes:
- Name
- Address
- Administrative area names
- Latitude & Longitude
- Geometry (Point, SRID 4326)

### Description:
This dataset contains the locations of coffee shops mapped by OpenStreetMap contributors. It represents the supply side of café accessibility.

### Limitations:
- OSM is crowd-sourced → may contain missing or outdated entries
- Some cafés may not yet be mapped
- Attribute completeness varies

---

## 2. Administrative Boundaries

**Source:** GADM (Global Administrative Areas Database)  
**Data Type:** Polygon Geometry  
**Format:** Shapefile (.shp) → Imported into PostGIS  

### Spatial Details:
- Level: Subdistrict (Kecamatan)
- Coordinate System: WGS84 (EPSG:4326)

### Description:
This dataset provides the spatial boundaries required for aggregating coffee shop counts and performing spatial joins.

### Limitations:
- Boundary data may not reflect recent administrative changes
- Minor geometric inaccuracies possible

---

## 3. Population Statistics

**Source:** Jakarta Open Data Portal  
**Data Type:** Tabular Data (Non-Spatial)  
**Format:** Excel → CSV → PostgreSQL  

### Attributes:
- Reporting period
- District name
- Subdistrict name
- Total population
- Population density

### Description:
This dataset represents the demand side of the analysis, allowing accessibility metrics to be calculated.

### Limitations:
- Temporal differences between datasets
- Naming inconsistencies requiring normalization

---

## 4. Data Integration Process

To ensure consistency across datasets:

- Administrative names were standardized using SQL string cleaning
- Spatial joins linked café points to administrative polygons
- Region identifiers were introduced to maintain relational integrity

---

## 5. Coordinate Reference System

All spatial datasets were standardized to:

**EPSG:4326 — WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System**

This ensures compatibility across PostGIS, QGIS, and web mapping platforms.

---

## Summary

The integration of open spatial data and official demographic statistics enables a comprehensive analysis of service accessibility. However, results should be interpreted with consideration of data completeness and temporal limitations.
